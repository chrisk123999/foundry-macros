# Module Requirements  
Midi-Qol (and it's own associated requirements)  
Template Macros  
# Notes  
- Currently the token won't take damage if it passes through the template but does not stop in it. This is a limitation of template macros.  
- The scene must use "ft" as it's grid.  
# Setup Instructions  
Import the Spike Growth json file.
