# Readme
Macros and automations I've made for my own personal D&D games in Foundry (v10).  
Documentation is a work in progress. Most macros are either an Item Macro or a actor OnUse macro applied with "flags.midi-qol.onUseMacroName".  
I don't generally embed my Item Macros inside the items/features/spells they're used in. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
